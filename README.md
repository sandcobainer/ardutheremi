## Building touch free music instruments.

Implementing hands free or touch free musical instruments with precision and accuracy is a challenging problem in music/audio technology. 
Thanks to the rise of modern AI (machine learning in specific), small instruments have more power than we can imagine. Combine it with the wide range of Digital Audio Workstations, we have a complete instrument that can be played, triggered or mixed live by a musician.

## Real Time Machine Learning:

I attempt to use real time programming, proximity sensing, light sensing and gesture recognition to create a complete instrument that can be used a MIDI trigger, a sine wave theremin, Digital Audio Effects Pedal.

Gesture Recognition with Machine Learning:
Use hand and body gesture recognition by processing video stream from the microcontroller.
- Needs an computer vision algorithm to calculate 3D distance
OR
Use Microsoft Kinect to process video in 3 Dimensions.
