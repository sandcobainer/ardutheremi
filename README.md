Theremin implemented on Arduino and Raspberry Pi 3B using ultrasonic range sensors

## Building touch free music instruments using basic micro-controllers

Implementing hands free or touch free musical instruments with precision and accuracy is a relevant problem in building real time music instruments.

This projects explores 2 famous options for building projects. One is a micro-controller, Arduino while the RPI is a full functioning computer. *Found that using Raspberry Pi is an overkill as the processing is done on Max/MSP or Pure data anyway. However, RPi can be used with other projects such as Sonic Pi to create interesting and small wireless instruments.

## Experimental results:

I experimented with real time programming, proximity sensing, light sensing, touch sensing. Proximity sensing or ultrasonic distance sensing proved to be the easiest and robust way to control the pitch and volume of a theremin.

Although the pitch and volume are very responsive and play the accurate frequency on an oscillator, the range of the instrument is very small for the user to approximate.

The inability to switch between sounds or waveshapes is also a limitation on this small device.
